Every piece of scientific instrument needs a software with control and data logging ability. For thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatography the same thing applies.
I've deloped a desktop software together with my colleauge to provide a GUI interface for the user to control electronics (such as heaters, humidity sensors, cooling fans, valves, etc) and build timed sequences to do that. All the data generated from the sensors are logged and could be read in data processing software for post processing.
