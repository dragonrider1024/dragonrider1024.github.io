Wen is a software development scientist at [Scilligence Corp](https://www.scilligence.com/web/) where he is working on multiple projects, including ASP.NET web application development. Before he was a Senior Scientist at the [Center for Aerosol & Cloud Chemistry](http://www.aerodyne.com/aerosol-cloud-chemistry) in [Aerodyne Research, Inc.](http://www.aerodyne.com), where he started as a Postdoctoral Scientist and got promoted to the senior scientist position in 2017. Prior to joining Aerodyne, Wen received Doctoral Degree in [Physical Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry) from [Texas A&M University, College Station](http://www.tamu.edu) in 2014. Wen is from China and earned his bachelor's degree in [Chemical Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_physics) from [University of Science & Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn). Along with research and production endeavors at Aerodyne, Wen has been working on software development, i.e., the desktop control software for a [thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatograph](https://sites.google.com/site/tagaerosol/software) instrument. Wen also loves [data visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization), using [dash plotly](https://dash.plot.ly) and machine learning, especially deep learning tools, such as [convolutional](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) and [recurrent neural networks](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/), to find underlying principles of interesting dataset.
