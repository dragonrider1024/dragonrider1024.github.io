Wen is a Senior Scientist in the [Center for Aerosol & Cloud Chemistry](http://www.aerodyne.com/aerosol-cloud-chemistry) at [Aerodyne Research, Inc.](http://www.aerodyne.com). He started at Aerodyne as a Postdoctoral Scientist and got promote to current position at 2017. Before joining Aerodyne, he got his Doctoral Degree in [Physical Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry) at [Texas A&M University, College Station](http://www.tamu.edu) in 2014. He was born and originally from China and got his bachelor's degree in [Chemical Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_physics) at [University of Science & Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn). Besides research endeavors in chemistry, he had worked on several software developments, including a desktop control software for a [thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatograph](https://sites.google.com/site/tagaerosol/software) instrument. As a person with physical science background, he loves [data visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization), using tools such as, [dash plotly](https://dash.plot.ly) and machine learning, especially deep learning tools, such as [convolutional](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) and [recurrent neural networks](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/), to help find underlying principles of interesting dataset.
