## Problem description
>Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

>Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

>Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.
Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).

## Solution:
1. First step is to find the key in the tree. If it is not found. We are done. This step takes O(log(n))
2. If the node has no right child, we can just set the child of its parent to be this node's left child. (The leftness and rightness depends of parent node depends on whether this node is left or right child of its parent). This step takes O(1)
3. If the node has right child, we can employ continous tree rotation operations to make its right child to be None. In details, after each rotation, if right child is not None, then right child's left child become key node's right child.

Code is shown below

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    
    def deleteNode(self, root: TreeNode, key: int) -> TreeNode:
        if root == None:
            return root
        parent = None
        current = root
        while current and current.val != key:
            parent = current
            if current.val > key:
                current = current.left
            else:
                current = current.right
        # key not found
        if current == None:
            return root
        
        # left rotate tree using key node as pivot, untils its right child is None
        while current.right:            
            temp = current.right.left
            current.right.left = current
            temp2 = current.right
            current.right = temp
            if parent == None:
                root = temp2 #if key is root, reset the root
            else:
                if current == parent.left:
                    parent.left = temp2
                else:
                    parent.right = temp2
            parent = temp2 #reset parent node

            
        if parent == None: #no rotation performed and key is root
            return current.left
        else: #after all rotation, key's right child is None
            if current == parent.left:
                parent.left = current.left
            else:
                parent.right = current.left
            return root
