### Problem description
Find the sum of all left leaves in a given binary tree.

```
Example:

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively. Return 24.
```

### Solution
We do post order traversal of the tree. For each node, we check whether its left child is leaf(that means node.left.left == None and node.left.right == None). If it is leaf, we add the val of its left child to the ans.

Below is python implementation

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def sumOfLeftLeaves(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.sum = 0
        
        def dfs(root: TreeNode)->None:
            if not root:
                return
            dfs(root.left)
            dfs(root.right)
            if root.left and root.left.right == None and root.left.left == None:
                self.sum += root.left.val
        
        dfs(root)
        return self.sum
				
```
