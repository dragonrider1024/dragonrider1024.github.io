### Problem description
Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:

Input:
11110
11010
11000
00000

Output: 1
Example 2:

Input:
11000
11000
00100
00011

Output: 3

### Solution
We can use DFS to change all connected 1's to X, and count groups of connected 1's.

Below is my python implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        count = 0
        m = len(grid)
        if m == 0:
            return 0
        n = len(grid[0])
        
        def neighbors(x:int, y:int)->List[List[int]]:
            ans = []
            if x + 1 < m and grid[x + 1][y] == '1':
                ans.append([x + 1, y])
            if x - 1 >= 0 and grid[x - 1][y] == '1':
                ans.append([x - 1, y])
            if y + 1 < n and grid[x][y + 1] == '1':
                ans.append([x, y + 1])
            if y - 1 >= 0 and grid[x][y - 1] == '1':
                ans.append([x, y - 1])
            return ans
        
        def dfs(i:int, j:int)->None: #mark 1's with X. When finish on island, add count by 1
            grid[i][j] = 'X'
            for neighbor in neighbors(i, j):
                x, y = neighbor
                dfs(x, y)
            return
        
        
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    dfs(i, j)
                    count += 1
        return count
				
				
```
