## Problem description
Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. The width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The binary tree has the same structure as a full binary tree, but some nodes are null.

The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and right most non-null nodes in the level, where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

Example 1:
```
Input: 

           1
         /   \
        3     2
       / \     \  
      5   3     9 

Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 4 (5,3,null,9).
Example 2:

Input: 

          1
         /  
        3    
       / \       
      5   3     

Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the third level with the length 2 (5,3).
Example 3:

Input: 

          1
         / \
        3   2 
       /        
      5      

Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width existing in the second level with the length 2 (3,2).
Example 4:

Input: 

          1
         / \
        3   2
       /     \  
      5       9 
     /         \
    6           7
Output: 8
Explanation:The maximum width existing in the fourth level with the length 8 (6,null,null,null,null,null,null,7).
```

## Solution
### BFS
1. We do level order traversal of the tree. For each node, we add additional information as the level it belongs and its x coordinate. Then for each level, we calculates the width as the difference of x coordinate between the rightmost node and leftmost node. The maximum difference among all the levels are the width of the binary tree

Below is python implementation

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def widthOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        queue = collections.deque()
        if not root:
            return 0
        queue.append((root,0,0))
        ans = 1
        left = right = None
        while queue:
            n = len(queue)
            for i in range(n):
                node, x, y = queue.popleft()
                if node.left:
                    queue.append((node.left, 2 * x, y + 1))
                if node.right:
                    queue.append((node.right, 2 * x + 1, y + 1))
                if i == 0:
                    left = x
                if i == n - 1:
                    right = x
                    ans = max(ans, right - left + 1)
        return ans
				
```


### DFS
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def widthOfBinaryTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        levelboundary = {}
        self.ans = 0
        
        def dfs(root, x:int, y:int)->None: #x and y coordinate of current node
            if not root:
                return
            if y in levelboundary:
                if x < levelboundary[y][0]:
                    levelboundary[y][0] = x
                if x > levelboundary[y][1]:
                    levelboundary[y][1] = x
            else:
                levelboundary[y] = [None, None]
                levelboundary[y][0] = x
                levelboundary[y][1] = x
            self.ans = max(self.ans, levelboundary[y][1] - levelboundary[y][0] + 1)
            dfs(root.left, 2*x, y + 1)
            dfs(root.right, 2*x + 1, y + 1)
        
        dfs(root, 0, 0)
        return self.ans
                    
```
