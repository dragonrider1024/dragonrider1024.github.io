### Problem description
Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

Note: 
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
       5
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   2   4
  /
 1
Output: 3
Follow up:
What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

### Solution
1. Let left be the count of nodes in left subtree, if k = 1 + left, then root is the answer. If k > 1 + left, then the answer is in right subtree with modified k = k - 1 - left

Below is python implementation

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: TreeNode, k: int) -> int:
        self.ans = 0
        
        def dfs(root:TreeNode, k:int)->int:
            if root == None:
                return 0
            left = dfs(root.left, k)
            if k == 1 + left:
                self.ans = root.val
            right = dfs(root.right, k - left - 1)
            return 1 + left + right
        
        dfs(root, k)
        return self.ans
