### Problem description
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Example: 

You may serialize the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
     / \
    4   5

as "[1,2,3,null,null,4,5]"
Clarification: The above format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Note: Do not use class member/global/static variables to store states. Your serialize and deserialize algorithms should be stateless.


### Solution
1. I've used Level Order Traversal to serialize and deserialize the binary tree

Below is my python implementation

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.
        
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        ans = []
        current = root
        queue = collections.deque()
        queue.append(root)
        if root == None:
            return ""
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            if node:
                ans.append(str(node.val))
                queue.append(node.left)
                queue.append(node.right)
            else:
                ans.append('null')
        return ','.join(ans)

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.
        
        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        if data == "":
            return None
        ans = data.split(',')
        queue = collections.deque()
        i = 0
        root = TreeNode(int(ans[0]))
        queue.append(root)
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            if node:
                i += 1
                if ans[i] == 'null':
                    queue.append(None)
                else:
                    left = TreeNode(int(ans[i]))
                    node.left = left
                    queue.append(left)
                i += 1
                if ans[i] == 'null':
                    queue.append(None)
                else:
                    right = TreeNode(int(ans[i]))
                    node.right = right
                    queue.append(right)
            else:
                pass
        return root
                
        
        

# Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
# codec = Codec()
# codec.deserialize(codec.serialize(root))

```
